## 📖 About The Project

This repository serves as a portfolio of my early steps into Front-End development, specifically focusing on solidifying the fundamentals of **HTML** and **CSS**. The majority of the content here follows the **Codecademy** curriculum and includes various projects coded to reinforce learned concepts.

By exploring this repository, developers or recruiters can observe:
* Clean and Semantic HTML structure.
* Fundamental CSS styling and layout techniques.
* Consistency and discipline throughout the learning process.

## 🛠️ Built With

These projects are built using the fundamental building blocks of web development:

* **HTML5:** Semantic tags, forms, tables, and page structure.
* **CSS3:** Styling, typography, the Box Model, and basic layout implementation.

## 📂 Project List

This repo consists of independent projects, each located in its own folder. Below are some highlighted works found within the directory:

| Project Folder | Description | Key Concepts |
